# report
HTML defines the structure of the page, including a table to display the reports.
CSS styles the page for a clean and responsive layout.
JavaScript dynamically populates the table rows (<tr>) with data from the reports array. Each report entry creates a new row with cells for date, report name, and a download link.
Remember to replace the href property of the downloadLink element with the actual download link for each report. The data in the reports array can be replaced or dynamically fetched from an API depending on your application's needs.
